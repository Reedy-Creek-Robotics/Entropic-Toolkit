## General overview
The Tile edge detector is a useful alternative to odometry that is easy to implement and can localize your position on the field. What is needed to implement Tile Edge Dection is a webcam looking down at the field. Through a mathematical formula called a Hough Transform and calibration for your bot the program will spit out how far away you are from the tile edge and in turn your position on the field.

This program is intended only to be used with the FIRST FTC robot controller. Using it elsewhere may have unforseen consequences.
