## General overview
~~Tile edge detector overview. A few sentences on why you would want to use it and info on what it does.~~
The Tile edge detector is a useful alternative to odometry that is easy to implement and can localize your position on the field. What is needed to implement Tile Edge Dection is a webcam looking down at the field. Through a mathematical formula called a Hough Transform and calibration for your bot the program will spit out how far away you are from the tile edge and in turn your position on the field.

~~Statement that this intended to be used the FIRST FTC robot controller~~
This program is intended only to be used with the FIRST FTC robot controller. Using it elsewhere may have unforseen consequences.
